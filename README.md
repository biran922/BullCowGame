#BullCowGame is a Word guessing game developed via C++ and Unreal Engine 4.27.
The game is very simple, it generates a word randomly (from a list of words) that has no repeating letters( an isogram), then prompts the user to Guess the word, you're lives count is the word's length, if you guess a right letter in the right location you get a bull, if you guess the right letter but in the wrong location you get a cow.
